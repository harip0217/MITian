Hi, I'm HARIðŸ‘‹
I'm a Jr. Data Scientist (Google Certified Data Analytics Professional) & IBM Certified Data Science Professional.
ðŸ”­ I'm currently pursuing my undergrad degree in Computer Science here at @Tribhuvan Universitya, Nepal.
âš¡ Outside of work, I do love to spend my time in exercise to maintain a better physique and mental strength.
âš¡ The most appleaing thing about the domain of Software & Technology for me as a Data Scientist is: We can get the first hand experience on new emerging technology.
I'm best reached via LinkedIn and I love to meet new friends! So, please feel free to reach me if you have any topics to be discussed or interesting projects collaboration.
